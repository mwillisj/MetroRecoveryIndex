AMPAC members visited various asset management systems and observed and discussed the issues associated with each system.

A technical committee was formed within AMPAC to further engage the public in the understanding and review of the asset management methodologies and logic used to define preservation and restoration costs and schedules. A comprehensive inventory of assets took place for each asset management system. Where accessible, assets were visited, and their conditions were assessed. Based on the condition, actions required to restore the asset were identified, and the cost and timing were estimated. Through assessment of risk (probability and consequence of failures), activities were prioritized and communicated regarding urgency and the financial and resource requirements. In July and August 2015, the City of Chula Vista engaged a research firm to conduct a public opinion survey to identify resident priorities and secure input on potential local funding mechanisms (bond or sales tax) to upgrade, repair and maintain critical infrastructure.

Using the prescribed Treasury formula, staff has determined that up to $31 million of the revenue lost by the Convention Center is eligible for revenue replacement. Staff recommends replacing this revenue over two years rather than all at once. It is important to note that the General Fund serves as the financial backstop for the Convention Center so replacing lost revenue with ARPA funds significantly reduces risk to the General Fund. ARPA also allows the City to offset costs for COVID-related worker’s compensation trust fund expenses that can be tied to COVID-19 employee claims.

Often overlooked, many of Oregon’s small enterprises that are operated by immigrant Oregonians, often family-owned, have likewise suffered because exclusionary immigration policy prevents them from accessing pandemic relief. For instance, many ITIN-holders operate small enterprises and are ineligible for relief due to their immigration classification. Likewise, immigrant small enterprises may avoid pandemic relief operated through traditional systems because of systemic barriers. Many of these small enterprises are composed of essential workers who themselves are impacted by COVID-19. These small enterprises are also impacted by public health measures that close or limit their capacity. These compounding impacts magnify the disruption experienced by the immigrant small enterprise. These small enterprises are essential to Oregon, to our regional and local communities, and are necessary for our collective prosperity. Many have insufficient resources to continue to weather the disruptions and survive. Without relief, these small enterprises will be irreparably harmed. This harm reverberates through the communities in which the enterprises are rooted, impacting the people served, the jobs retained, and the cultural vibrancy they bring to Oregon.
